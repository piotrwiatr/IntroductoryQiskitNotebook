# IntroductoryQiskitNotebook

The following repo contains an introductory lesson to IBM's Qiskit Python library. The notebooks follow IBM's Basics of Quantum Information quite closely and all credit is given to them.

There are two notebooks:
- The Complete Notebook: Essentially a teacher's copy
- The Incomplete Notebook: The student's copy
